                        <p>Hello my fellow classmates! As you know, we are celebrating the survival of another semester here at Brigham Young University.<p>
                        <p> I must say, rounding the corner of another semester at BYU feels like completing an Ironman Triathlon in flip flops––seeming 
                            impossible at times, vigorous, worthwhile, and extremely worthy of a dance celebration.</p>
                        <p> Let us take a moment to reflect and remember the highs and lows we have experienced this semester. We each owe a tribute to our 
                            brilliant professors who challenge us, help us further our education, and continually invest in our lives to help us succeed as 
                            students, and life-long learners. A thank you also goes out to the friends who kept us sane (or at least tried to), and the 
                            consumption of caffeine that may or may not have fueled our late-night, last-minute study sessions.<p>
                        <p>Each of us have experienced the rollercoaster ride each semester brings. At times, we feel like we are riding the Tea-Cups 
                            ride at Disneyland––rapidly spinning in out of control circles, attempting to absorb as much information as possible.  Other 
                            moments feel similar to riding It’s A Small World where the repetition of assignments, quizzes, and exams mirror the persistent 
                            (and slightly annoying) soundtrack. I’m not sure about you, but some points in my semester have felt similar to the 183-foot drop 
                            experienced when riding the Tower of Terror (now Guardians of the Galaxy ride). The challenges and complexities are daunting and 
                            the learning curve seems more than EXTREMELY steep.</p> 
                        <p>These highs and lows are what make our college experience worthwhile. Spending hours in the testing center, long winded study 
                            sessions in the library, and the daily struggle (that at times seems impossible) of finding a parking spot on campus. These hurdles
                            shape us into resilient individuals, prepare us to conquer any challenge, and build our character everyday.</p>
                        <p> Among the challenges of being a student, it's important for us to take a moment to celebrate our achievements. Whether it's acing 
                            your tough exam that you thought you’d flunk, getting accepted into your desired program, or finally mastering the art of citing 
                            sources in APA format, each accomplishment, no matter how small, deserves to be celebrated.<p>
                            The thing I love very most about being a college student at Brigham Young University is realizing that I am not alone. 
                            I’m not the only student who currently has a D in Finance (although I may be one of the very few), I’m not the only one who gets 
                            nervous before filming each of these speeches (even though it’s online), and I’m not the only one who needs a barf bag when I think
                             about finals week…we are in this TOGETHER. We are bound by shared challenges and lifted by collective support. At Brigham Young 
                             University, the strength of our friendships and warmth of our community remind us that no matter the obstacle, we are united in 
                             our journey toward success.<p>
                        <p>So, my fellow classmates, as we celebrate the survival of another semester, let us raise a toast––not only to being survivors–– 
                            but also to thriving in the face of adversity, embracing the highs and lows, and cherishing the bonds that unite us as BYU students. 
                            May we continue to bloom and grow together. Cheers to whatever drink of choice will get you through the next couple weeks of the 
                            semester! Remember, we are in this together and can almost call ourselves semester survivors.</p>
